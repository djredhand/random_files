									</p>
									<h2 class="news-header red">Expecting the unexpected</h2>
									<p> I joined PwC as a new campus hire after a summer internship with another company. I thought I would start my career working primarily with a team through a manager. I had expected senior staff would be handling all the client interactions until I had been with the firm for a while. But on my first day, I was talking directly with clients, and then working with senior leaders. That was unexpected, yet I always had the full support of my team.</p>
									<p>Through many of my early interactions, especially with the more senior-level clients, I witnessed some high-level strategic decisions being made. I came into a project that was already in progress and was able to see how the client and the team were responding to challenges and working through the issues. As a new team member, it was exhilarating to be brought into a project like this right away and to be part of the conversation and solution. At the beginning, I certainly was not the direct point of contact, but it wasn’t long before my team trusted me. I wasn’t just part of the “little” things, I was part of the entire process and had real responsibility, which meant I had to be on my game. I didn’t know when I would get questions, so I had to be prepared by keeping up with research on the client’s history, activities and strategies. At such an early point in my career, this was really satisfying, and it boosted my confidence. Like many people who are new to a role in an organization, I sometimes questioned my ability when I joined the firm. “Did I have the right experience to tell clients something they don’t already know?” I have to say it was small wins and small successes that built my confidence, and I just ran with it. I had a desire to work hard, get ahead and really do some cool things. I’ve really been able to take advantage of the opportunities PwC provides.</p>

									<h2 class="news-header red">Relationships that have an impact</h2>
									<p>From the beginning, I worked with a couple of great managers on my team who helped me jump start my career. From the moment we started working together, they said, “We fully understand your background. We’re asking you to jump into the fire here and get up to speed. If you have questions, ask.” Their coaching was so valuable to me—they helped me understand how to be effective with clients and how to get my point across. When we were in front of a client, they always made sure I was prepared and they allowed me to ask the sorts of questions beginners have behind closed doors, so that when it came time for presenting, I would be articulate in front of the client. There was no expectation that I knew all the answers. It was okay for me to ask questions, even if I thought they were “rookie” questions. The culture is friendly and supportive, and that is what is so incredible about the firm. The fact that I could sit down one-on-one as an associate with our senior leaders and feel as comfortable with them as with peers, was inspiring.</p>

									<h2 class="news-header red">Sharing in a collaborative culture</h2>
									<p>We choreographed an interactive collaborative workshop for a client called Accelerated Solution Design (ASD). We gathered all of their key decision makers in an off-site location, discouraged interruptions from cell phones and laptops and helped them focus on how to tackle a strategic challenge they were facing. Before this workshop, our team spent about six weeks researching the company and their key challenges in the marketplace, the competition and internal organizational issues. So, when we came together, we were prepared to help them meet their objectives and formulate their strategy going forward. It was important to understand the client’s challenge from different perspectives. Some other PwC teams on the account had done work in these areas, including colleagues in San Jose and San Francisco, but we also brought in subject matter specialists from New York City and PwC India who had experience in the space. In order to come to the workshop with leading practice-type ideas—we picked their brains to identify the common challenges they had seen in these areas. By leveraging the knowledge and skills of our colleagues from across the firm during preparation for the workshop, we were able to have a far more interactive and rewarding conversation with the client. It really was a team effort to come to the workshop fully prepared, with a perspective, and do it all in a tight timeframe. We got some incredible information from the client and executed the workshop to the client’s satisfaction. We were able to anticipate many of the questions and challenges that surfaced and had the information ready to work through it. These workshops create a buzz around the client. People talk about these events for months—they’re very impactful. We’ve seen so much success with the ASDs, and have helped a lot of our clients. They’re being rolled out to other clients, and are gaining momentum. It was an incredible opportunity to be a part of this workshop at an early stage in my career. I was given considerable responsibility and I learned so much professionally and personally.</p>
									<p>Just in the past few years, I’ve had so many experiences that I could never have even dreamed of having. I’ve worked on a broad range of clients from software and consumer product companies to an online travel company where I learned about a call center application, the technology, and the strategy that goes behind it. I’ve also worked with a very large computer company that manages hundreds of accounts across the globe trying to improve their vendor relations. I helped the company understand where it could consolidate vendors and where the cost savings were.</p>
									<p>The breadth of experience that you can get within consulting at PwC is really unmatched. I’ve been able to see how all these different organizations run, both within the same and completely different business areas. It’s very hard for people coming out of school to know exactly what they want to do for the rest of their career. Being exposed to all these different experiences has been really valuable to me, because it has allowed me to see all of these things and decide where I want to focus and, and ultimately, where I feel I can have the greatest impact. I have so many opportunities available to me and I feel that I am encouraged and supported to drive my career path the way I want to with PwC.</p>

									<p>We've all heard about the importance of having a mentor in our careers, someone to help guide us, give us advice, and teach us things we need to know about the business world.  Mentoring is not a new concept and has been around in some form or fashion for a very long time.  But what if we decided to take a different approach to mentoring, turn things upside down and challenge the traditional approach we've always had to the mentoring relationship?  That is the idea behind the concept of the Reverse Mentoring Program PwC's Greater Atlanta Market has been piloting for the last year.  Reverse Mentoring challenges the traditional hierarchy and turns the traditional mentoring relationship upside down, by assigning new staff members as the mentors for more experienced, seasoned partners and principals.</p>

									<p>"Our view is that reverse mentoring is an opportunity for us to engage our people in a conversation around the things that are most important to the firm," says Gary Price, a partner in Advisory practice who was a mentee in the Atlanta market.</p>

									<p>For the Greater Atlanta market, the concept was born out of a desire by the Market Council leadership team to find better ways to connect with members of the rapidly growing millennial generation.  Inspired by the description of Reverse Mentoring in an article about ways to mentor millennials from the Harvard Business Review, the Market Council decided it would give the idea a try.   Each member of the market council was paired up with a staff member at either the Experienced Associate or Senior Associate level.  These Seniors and Associates serve as the "Mentors" to the market council leaders who are the "Mentees."  A few baseline parameters where established, including confidentiality and a commitment to meet regularly, but other than a few basic guidelines, the structure of the experience is left up to each pair to define.</p>

									<p>As the Mentor, each staff member is responsible for setting up monthly meetings with his or her mentee and for driving the agenda and picking topics for discussion.  The mentee is also encouraged to offer suggestions for discussion topics in areas where he or she might have questions or want the opinion of a staff member.  For example, a leader "mentee" might want to some guidance from his or her mentor about an upcoming staff meeting to understand how to better communicate with the staff and anticipate any areas of concern or topics to cover in the meeting.  The mentor can provide invaluable insight and an inside look directly into the morale of the practice.   Each quarter the mentors come together on a call to share best practices and talk about the experience each person is having in an effort to foster new ideas and topics to discuss with the mentees in order to keep the experience growing.</p>

									<p>Mentor/mentee relationships are important to opening a new line of communication, as demonstrated by Atlanta mentor, Vanessa Cook, a Tax practice senior associate and her mentee, Jeff Able, a partner in the Assurance practice.  "I've been able to build a personal relationship with my mentee and I think that it gives me the avenue to give advice and that advice will be taken into account," comments Vanessa.  Jeff appreciated the insight Vanessa was able to provide him that he would not otherwise have, "Though Vanessa has been with the firm for 10 months, and I've been with the firm for over 20 years, she knows things that I don't know that will make me better if I embrace them," he states.</p>

									<p>One natural area that the conversations gravitate towards is technology.   Many of the Mentor/Mentee pairs have talked about ways to better use technology on a daily basis to make work more efficient, whether it be by utilizing a particular App or by using technology as a means to better communicate with team members such as text messaging.</p>

									<p>Technology is just one entry point for the discussion between mentor and mentee.  As with more traditional mentoring roles, the key to success lies in the development of the relationship between mentor and mentee.  The deeper the relationship and the more each mentor and mentee invest in one another, the more benefit both parties will see.</p>

									<p>Reverse Mentoring is also a key way to increase our awareness of diversity issues.   Mixing mentor and mentee pairings to reflect a mix of race and genders can create a very positive learning experience and connection that leads to personal growth and deeper level of awareness by both people.  It's a great way to increase the cultural dexterity of those involved.</p>

	 								<p>The goal of Reverse Mentoring at PwC is not just to increase the connectivity between our partners/principals and staff or to reduce turnover.  PwC is exploring how to leverage this program in offices across the country in order to create better leaders at both the staff and partner/principal level through a shared experience that transcends differences in years of experience and provides self development for each person through the exchange of ideas and experiences.</p>

									<p>Professionals in PwC’s US Tax Services help businesses keep pace with tax legislation, regulatory developments and complex business challenges. As advisors adding value for their clients, Tax professionals at PwC can choose from many specialties, one of which is International Tax Services. The US firm’s International Tax Services group has a wealth of experience helping companies address their cross-border needs. Teams advise clients on multiple aspects of international taxation and help multinational businesses achieve their goals in a tax-efficient manner, both locally and globally. </p>
									<p>On Campus talked to Kirby Huelsebusch, a Senior Associate in the International Tax Services practice, and asked her to tell us about her experiences in the practice and how she is shaping her career path in this cutting-edge field.</p>
									<p>Kirby Huelsebusch<br/>
									International Tax Services<br/>
									Market: Cincinnati<br/>
									<br/>Joined PwC: October 2009<br/>
									College: University of Cincinnati</p>

									<h2 class="news-header orange">Enjoying a career that exceeds expectations</h2>
									<p>As an undergraduate student at the University of Cincinnati, I participated in the school’s work/study co-op program, where I was given the opportunity to gain real world work experience. I was able to test drive not only a position, but a company’s culture too. Having the opportunity to take on various responsibilities throughout my internships gave me a perspective on what I really wanted to do with my career. It was through my initial internship experiences that I turned to PwC for my final two rotations. At PwC, my internships provided the opportunity for me to explore my interests among the vast scope of services and specialities the firm has to offer. Having had the opportunity to assist PwC teams with various projects, I realized I was interested in the type of work the International Tax Services teams were doing for their clients. By the end of my internships, I was confident that this was the right specialty for me.</p>
									<p>What interested me the most about International Tax Services was the extensive high-level business issue research and the application of this research to each client’s unique circumstances. Exploring how each situation would be treated, in terms of understanding existing tax law and making an appropriate recommendation, was both dynamic and challenging. There are so many technical issues to delve into in International Tax. There is not always a clear-cut answer, but I really enjoyed the deep dive the teams took in developing solutions to some of these complex problems. I also knew from what I saw and heard in the industry that the international space was a really fast-growing area of tax, and I knew I wanted to be in an industry that was relevant to today’s global economy and that had a lot of growth potential. When I completed my internship, and was extended an offer to work with PwC, I confidently said, “When I come back full-time, I’d be interested in trying out a career in International Tax,” and it was my internship experience that provided me this insight. </p>
									<p>After I wrapped up my masters in accounting and received my CPA, I came to the firm as a full-time hire. In pursuing a career at PwC, I had expected that I would be surrounded by top tier talent, and consistently learning and moving forward with my career. The people in my home office are influential mentors and our client base is strong.</p>
									
									<h2 class="news-header orange">Teaming for success</h2>
									<p>Each day is fresh, things are always changing, and I don’t know exactly what will be in store. I spend a significant amount of time liaising with international offices and PwC network firms around the world. My primary goal is to analyze tax issues not only from a US-based perspective, but also to consider them from global viewpoints. The relationships I have built with my clients and colleagues within the firm are critical to my role. The more I’ve interacted and collaborated, the stronger these relationships have become. I’ve found that my colleagues are more than willing to accept questions and offer guidance and mentorship. They spend time discussing my projects and coaching me, and they have been very inclusive. </p>
									<p>Through the trusted relationships I’ve built, I have been given responsibility and the opportunity to take ownership of projects, all while growing as a professional. As a result of my experiences, I’ve been given the trust to lead initiatives and observed how the people here have tailored their careers—it seems like no one follows precisely the same path and I am also carving my own path. I found the key is making sure that I speak up and communicate what it is I am looking to do next.</p>

									<h2 class="news-header orange">Growing as a well-rounded professional</h2>
									<p>It’s not uncommon to be concerned that once you start working full-time, it can be tough to balance your personal life. By making a concerted effort to get involved in my community and stay active with friends, I’ve been able to fill my life with things I really enjoy. I’ve even played intramural softball with my home office. Interacting with and getting to know co-workers outside of work has been a lot of fun. Beyond intramurals, I’ve participated in the firm’s campus recruiting leadership program, Elevate, serving as a team leader, and helped out at PwC recruiting events at my alma mater. It has been a rewarding opportunity to offer students first-hand knowledge about life at the firm. I am able to be candid with students and help them make career choices that fit their unique goals. Additionally, the firm’s commitment to community service has allowed me the opportunity to spend a day building houses for Habitat for Humanity and to spend time making lunches to feed the homeless and disadvantaged people in my community, through Martha’s Table. </p>

									<p>The encouragement extended by my team to support me in finding balance in work and life has reminded me to step back and say, “There’s more to life than just work. To be a successful, well-rounded professional, you need to think about all aspects of life.” I’ve learned the key to achieving this balance is good two-way communication and planning with my team to make sure client commitments are met and projects completed. It’s been very clear to me from the time I started with the firm that the people here want you to succeed. They want you to be happy while you’re here so that you can see yourself having a long-term career with PwC.</p>

									<p>As an employer of almost 8,000 interns and new full-time associates from campuses across the country each year, PwC knows that students may seek employment opportunities in geographic areas beyond where they go to school. Sometimes students want to work in a city that brings them closer to family, others want to try living in a new city after they graduate, or some students want to move to a market where they can find industry opportunities aligned with their passions. Whatever the reason, at PwC, we do our best to help students find positions in the cities they prefer. Our culture of flexibility encompasses geographic mobility and is one way how we help our people grow their own way. <br/><br/>
									On Campus recently caught up with Aaron Lasher and Chelsea Dickinson, two students joining PwC full-time next fall, to talk with them about how they landed career opportunities with PwC in offices that seem unexpected relative to where they are going to school.<br/><br/>

									<b>Aaron Lasher</b><br/>
									Indiana University<br/>
									Bloomington, IN</p>

									<p><b>PwC / In which office were you interested in working?</b><br/>
									<b>Aaron</b> As a lifelong fan of cars, Detroit is the place to be. Detroit is filled with the rich history of the American automotive industry and still serves as the heart of its worldwide operations. When a partner from PwC’s Detroit office traveled to Indiana University to talk about the office and his clients, I was really impressed with the interactions that he’d had with some of the major players in the industry. I could tell from his experiences that the firm would give me the opportunity to work within an industry I’ve always loved.</p>

									<p>Recently, I was approached by a new associate in our Atlanta office who had read some advice I had given to college freshmen on Reuters.com. The new associate asked if I had any specific career advice for someone just starting out at PwC. I replied to her directly and then also shared this advice in a blog with all PwC staff through our internal social media platform. Since you are a student who will soon be starting a new career, I also thought I’d share my advice with you. </p>

									<p><font style="color:#E41926">1. More than the breadth of your work, your personal brand is defined by the quality of your work.</font> Whether you’re a first year associate or a senior manager with a wealth of experience, look for opportunities to exhibit everyday leadership. Do well in the tasks you are asked to perform, but then extend yourself to do even more<br/><br/>

									<font style="color:#E41926">2.  Remember, leadership occurs at all levels.</font> Whether you’re a first year associate or a senior manager with a wealth of experience, look for opportunities to exhibit everyday leadership. Do well in the tasks you are asked to perform, but then extend yourself to do even more. <br/><br/>

									<font style="color:#E41926">3.  Get smart about the organization you have joined</font> Get to know all of the different services your company has to offer...explore and experience a few if you can. You’ll be in a better position to add value in your role, and in the process you’ll expand your network.<br/><br/>

									<font style="color:#E41926">4.  Network, network, network!</font> You may not realize it now, but many of your peers today will not only be your colleagues, but may also be clients or service providers tomorrow. <br/><br/>

									<font style="color:#E41926">5. Ask for feedback...</font><br/><br/>

									<font style="color:#E41926">6. ...then act on that feedback when appropriate.</font>  (And recognize that not all feedback comes by way of a formal sit down meeting or in a written form. Take it and learn from it in whatever form it comes.) <br/><br/>

									<font style="color:#E41926">7. Learn as much as you can with the opportunities provided...</font>whether through your assignments, in the classroom, via self study or learning from other teams. And never be complacent—continually seek out new opportunities, especially those outside your comfort zone.<br/><br/>

									<font style="color:#E41926">8. Don’t forget you are part of a team.</font> No one can do it alone. So be a great team member, support your colleagues, put yourself in others’ shoes...and think about how you will create and lead teams in the future. <br/><br/>

									<font style="color:#E41926">9. Give back. </font> We are privileged to have jobs and be in the position to give, and, whenever we can, we should give back to our communities, be responsible leaders, and help people in need.<br/><br/>

									<font style="color:#E41926">10. Finally, make sure it isn’t all just work.</font> Enjoy life and take advantage of your organization’s flexibility to pursue your passions outside of work. Don’t treat your career as a sprint to the finish line, but as a marathon that will last many years. <br/><br/>

									<p>There are some parts of your school schedule you can’t control. Classes, projects, deadlines, and test preparation, just to name a few. Add up enough of these, and time you can dedicate to your schoolwork gets scarcer. When your time is limited, you’ve got to work harder to make it all count. Here are four tips to help you make the time that you do dedicate to your schoolwork work harder, so you can get to all the other things you have to do:</p>

									<p><font style="color:#E41926">1. Make a list. </font> Before you roll your eyes, try it. Put a box next to each thing and check it off as you go. Or scratch it off. Write it on your hand. Or write it on an enormous piece of paper. Knowing what you’ve got to do is the first step to doing it.<br/><br/>

									<font style="color:#E41926">2. Find your "best time".</font> Whether you’ve thought about it consciously or not, everyone has times of the day when they are at their most productive. Whether its 3 PM to 5 PM in the afternoon or midnight to 2 AM, find it.   <br/><br/>

									<font style="color:#E41926">3.  Protect it. Distractions</font>, emergencies, last minute stuff. Whatever you call them, if they cut into your “best time,” think about whether they’re really worth your time. A little commitment now will give you far more free time later.  <br/><br/>

									<font style="color:#E41926">4. Know your weaknesses. </font>If it’s the phone, turn off the ringer. If it’s the television, unplug it. If it’s music, turn it off. If it’s silence, turn the music on. If you’re a clock-watcher, tape a piece of paper over the display. <br/><br/>
									</p>
									<p>Managing your time requires self-discipline, and nobody’s perfect. And rest assured that it will be worth it in the end.<br/><br/>

									Time management is not just something that will help you now; it’s something that you absolutely have to learn to be successful in your career. We invite you to jump-start your career by visiting <a href="http://www.pwc.com/us/personalbrand">www.pwc.com/us/personalbrand</a></p>

									<p>As you no doubt know, “Corporate Responsibility” has become a hot phrase in company-speak over the last several years. What’s confusing is that it encompasses many different efforts and can mean different things from business to business. For us, a big part is giving back to our communities and doing so in ways that we know will make a difference—both to our communities and to our people.</p>

									<p>For our people, working with our communities is both fulfilling and educational—we hone existing skills and learn new ones, develop new networks, challenge ourselves, get chances to help those in need in ways we never would have had otherwise, and identify for others what we consider important.<br/><br/>

									Given how important this is to us, we spent almost three years looking where we should focus our efforts, talking internally and doing outside research. We heard time and again that our people were looking for ways to get involved locally and beyond, and so whatever we focused on had to provide those kinds of opportunities. Thus, this past year, we decided to focus on financial literacy and started a five-year commitment to donate $60 million and one million service hours (worth $100 million) toward youth education. We call this effort Earn Your Future, and helping train and equip teachers is a big part of it. <br/><br/>

									Why financial literacy? Because far too many students graduate high school without the basic personal and business financial skills they need to succeed, too few teachers have the training to teach classes, too many schools lack the resources to train teachers, and too many businesses are unable to hire employees with the basic economic skills needed for their jobs.<br/><br/>

									Here are some of the many facts that motivate us: <br/>
									Less than half of high school graduates understand that paying only a credit card’s monthly minimum 	balance would result in higher annual payments than paying off their debts in full each month; 35% percent of teens do not know how to write a check; and Less than 20% of teachers say they have the knowledge to teach a financial literacy class.1 <br/><br/>

									That’s the “why.” We are approaching the “how” in different ways. For example, our people are getting involved directly and we are providing our people and teachers with educational resources. We created 18 financial literacy curriculum modules that our people, from interns to partners and principals, can use in schools across the country. These lessons are free of charge, designed for students in grades 3-12, and include lessons on credits &amp; debits, identity theft, savings &amp; investments, incomes &amp; careers, and planning &amp; money management. <br/><br/>

									Another way we are attacking the problem is through working with other organizations. For example, we are working with Knowledge@Wharton High School (KWHS). KWHS is a part of The Wharton School that creates opportunities for students and educators to explore their business-related interests, both inside and outside of the classroom. Promoting global financial literacy has been one of its core missions. <br/><br/>

									Working with KWHS, we took a big step forward this past fall when PwC and KWHS held a three-day training seminar for more than 225 educators, 150 of whom came to Philadelphia. Over those three days, teachers learned how to teach such diverse topics as savings and investments, risk management, and negotiation. We learned a great deal back from the teachers, who also reinforced how important financial literacy is. <br/><br/>

									For example, one teacher told us “I saw so many homes torn apart by personal finance issues. That motivated me to empower people to make the best choices in the financial world.” <br/><br/>

									You might be wondering how you can get involved and begin helping out right now. Here are some possibilities: <br/>

									Get in the classroom and teach students through grade 12 one or more aspects of financial literacy, such 	as budgeting; Tutor and mentor school children on the issue – this might not be a novel approach, but it’s proven; and Teach students on the issue though youth education organizations such as Junior Achievement, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, and Boys &amp; Girls Clubs. <br/><br/>

									On a final note, there’s one more way you can make a direct difference in students’ lives—all you need is your phone or a camera. We’re asking you to use Facebook and Instagram to upload an original photograph that answers the question, What does making a difference mean to you? We will choose the top 24 entrants and the public will then choose the winners. Using www.DonorsChoose.org, one grand prize winner will direct our donation of $10,000 to worthwhile classroom projects throughout the United States, and 10 runners-up will direct donations of $1,000 each to classroom projects of their choice.

									<p> Building a strong personal brand is critical to helping you stand out in a competitive marketplace. In building your personal brand, you define your individuality, maximize your strengths, and manage your choices to create future opportunities that are in line with who you are and where you want to go. It’s time to take charge of your future and step up to stand out!<br/><br/>
									
									A strong personal brand it rooted in authenticity. You need to be clear on who you are, what makes you tick, and what you want to be known for so you can differentiate yourself from the crowd. Follow the steps outlined here to build an authentic brand that will help you become a keeper in the job search.</p>

									<h2 class="news-header orange">Step 1: Define your X Factor</h2>
									<p>The first step is to discover your unique strengths—the things that set you apart from others. Ask yourself the questions below, then validate your responses by getting feedback from others.<br/><br/>

									1 What makes you stand out?<br/>
									2 Which of your skills motivate you?<br/>
									3 Which get others excited about you?<br/>
									4 What do you want to be known for?<br/><br/>

									If you build a reputation based on your strengths, you’ll be well positioned to leap over tall stacks of resumes in a single bound. </p>

									<h2 class="news-header orange">Step 2: Understand your whY Factor</h2>
									<p>Once you have greater clarity on your strengths, it’s time to dig a little deeper into who you are, what makes you tick and what’s important to you. Start by focusing on your values, passions, and purpose. Your values are your personal compass—they drive your behaviors. Your passions are a renewable energy source that fuels your actions. And your purpose is your vision of what you’d like to achieve and serves as the internal roadmap that points your decision-making in the right direction.<br/><br/>

									If you truly understand your whY Factor, you can design a career plan that connects with your values, passions and purpose. When you’re living in alignment with your values and integrating your passions into what you do, you’re excited, engaged and totally unstoppable. </p>

									<h2 class="news-header orange">Step 3: Eliminate your Zzz Factor</h2>
									<p>Once you’ve nailed down your X and whY factors, it’s time to focus on communicating your unique promise of value to the world. Your personal brand is the reputation you’ve built with people in all walks of your life, and each interaction you have with others creates a memorable experience that teaches them what they can expect from you. It’s up to you to eliminate your Zzz factor and be a keeper, not a sleeper!<br/><br/>

									Storytelling is a great tool for you to convey the essence of who you are versus just sharing a laundry list of what you’ve done. In today’s competitive marketplace, you need to be memorable and communicate the authentic you while setting yourself apart from others who may be competing for the same opportunities.<br/><br/> 

									Telling your story goes beyond what you say. What you do says volumes about you. First impressions matter. Don’t let something as small as professional attire or body language sink your ship before you’ve even spoken. Amp up your interview with strong professional presence and memorable and relevant stories that showcase the real you in action.<br/><br/>

									Don’t forget the importance of networking. Networking can happen anytime, anyplace, if you’re on the lookout for it. Create a networking plan to make sure you’re getting your name and face out there in a meaningful and memorable way. Remember, networking can be even more powerful when it begins face-to-face and then is sustained through bits and bytes. </p>

									<h2 class="news-header orange">Step 4: Ready, Set, Show</h2>
									<p>Leap off the page with career marketing tools that pack a punch. Your resume and bio should reflect who you are, not just what you’ve done. They create an experience of you in the mind of the reader before they even meet you. Through these tools, you can build emotional connections so others want to get to know you better. To leap off the page and become top of mind to your recruiter, focus on marketing brand you through charismatic cover letters, resumes that resonate, branded bios, and giving “thanks that ranks.” <br/><br/>

									Stand out online by building your brand in bits and bytes. Social media tools like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube can help you express your brand to a much larger audience. You want people to see the real you in the virtual world. Chances are you’re already using social media in a variety of ways. It’s important to remember that what you put on the Internet is captured there for posterity. Not only can your current network access this material, so can your future contacts, employers and network influencers. At lightning speed, you can positively or negatively impact your brand. Make good choices so that your virtual brand reflects the true you.<br/><br/>

									PwC’s personal brand experience—Step Up to Stand Out—will help you find and showcase your strengths so you can stand out from the crowd. By tapping into your unique skills, talents and passions, you can leap off the pages of your resume and become top of mind to your recruiters. <br/><br/>

									<p>Professionals in PwC’s US Assurance practice work closely with public and private companies to help solve complex business issues. Serving the public interest, they also support the capital markets system through reliable financial reporting. <br/><br/>

									PwC Assurance teams ask questions, test assumptions, and make sure companies are reporting information on which investors and others can rely. PwC Assurance professionals combine deep technical skills and sector experience to help our clients address the challenges of a rapidly changing environment and strengthen their businesses. <br/><br/>

									Speaking with On Campus newsletter, Ashley Saddock, an Experienced Associate in the Assurance practice, talked about her experiences—her path from college to a role with the firm—and the career flexibility and opportunities for learning, leadership, and advancement she has discovered working at PwC.<br/><br/>

									<b>Ashley Saddock<br/>
									Assurance – Technology, Products, &amp; Services<br/>
									Market: Charlotte, NC<br/>
									Joined PwC: September 2010<br/>
									College: University of North Carolina–Charlotte</b>
									</p>



									<h2 class="news-header maroon">Finding flexibility </h2>
									<p>After graduation, Ashley Saddock, an English Literature major from the University of North Carolina–Greensboro, stumbled upon her interest in the profession when she relocated to Michigan and accepted an accounting position with an insurance and risk management firm. “I initially took the job just to pay my bills while I looked for something else,” she said. “But after a very short time, I discovered I really liked accounting.” Over her tenure there, she developed a strong accounting foundation, eventually working her way into a position in financial statement reporting and as manager of regulatory compliance. In her fourth year with the company, Ashley decided she wanted to take her professional career a step further and become a CPA, which meant going back to school. Having worked alongside auditors through three external audits as a client she decided, “I’m going to give auditing a go.” <br/><br/>

									Moving back to North Carolina, Ashley obtained a master’s degree in accounting at the University of North Carolina–Charlotte and quickly decided she wanted to work for PwC. After an internship with PwC in 2009, she accepted a full-time position in the Assurance practice. “I requested to be placed in the Financial Services practice and specifically focus on insurance companies—which was a great match for my experience.”<br/><br/>

									For two years, Ashley audited clients within the insurance industry, at which point she determined that she was at a good point in her career to branch away from the insurance industry to enhance both her accounting and audit skills in another industry. “Leveraging PwC’s internal mobility, I transferred out of Financial Services and into the Technology, Products and Services practice to gain valuable experience,” she explained. Today, she works on public manufacturing and retail Assurance clients. Throughout her career at PwC, Ashley has appreciated the great degree of flexibility and the opportunities which have enabled her to further define her career path and diversify her professional experience.<br/><br/>

									Ashley not only found flexibility in her day-to-day work, but also the way in which her work is completed. She has been able to coordinate “work from home days” and flexibility with her work hours, while still meeting client demands, which has had a positive impact on her ability to balance work with her personal life. “Working from home or having the ability to work alternative hours gives me the flexibility to be able to make a personal meeting, or a doctor’s appointment, or a family event when needed. As long as client needs are met, I feel support from my teams for this flexibility. I’ve been able to coordinate my schedule with my teams to be sure I don’t have to sacrifice important personal events in my life for work. I can balance life and work without sacrificing one for the other. I work with amazing people and my teams are very understanding and supportive.”</p>

									<h2 class="news-header maroon">Becoming a CPA</h2>
									<p>It’s critical to get your credential in order to grow your career at PwC. Ashley focused on completing all of her exams in the three months before she started working at the firm. “I’d suggest taking the CPA exam early—when you’re still in a study mode, after you have just graduated, but you haven’t started working yet. Treat your CPA like a class and finish your last class,” she said. However, for those who wait to take the CPA until you join the firm, Ashley commented, “On my teams, we are always mindful of who is studying and when tests are scheduled, encouraging and helping those individuals to balance their workload with studying prior to the tests.”</p>

									<h2 class="news-header maroon">Leveraging GADM (Global Assurance Delivery Model) </h2>
									<p>Engagement teams collaborate with GADM team members to manage and complete the various parts of a client engagement. This type of collaboration helps streamline certain audit activities. “We put together background briefs and instructions for GADM, and then they become just like another team member who helps to accomplish tasks and get the audit completed.” Using GADM allows first year associates and experienced associates the ability to better use the time they spend with our clients, often taking a deeper dive into their business. It also affords them the opportunity to strengthen valuable project management and coaching skills, as they are often the team members who make decisions pertaining to how the work is completed, are the points of contact for the tasks, and typically perform the first level of review. <br/><br/>

									Working with GADM represents to Ashley yet another opportunity that she has used to grow her own way with PwC and to set her own course for her future with the firm. “I have always volunteered to manage the GADM projects on my teams, because it is another opportunity for me to demonstrate my knowledge of auditing and accounting and to further develop managerial and leadership skills,” Ashley said. “As I see it, my ability to own and control the work I do and to become a leader within the firm can only be progressed—or limited—by my own ambition and drive. So, I’ve communicated what I’d like to do to my network so that people think of me when opportunities arise. Of course you can’t get everything you want, but each assignment I’ve had has taught me something new and valuable, and I’ve always managed to have the interactions to gain the project management and leadership skills I’ve wanted and needed to reach my career goals. It’s all about keeping up constant communication with your teams and mentors: where do you want your career to go and what can you do today, next week, or next year to get there?” </p>

									<h2 class="news-header maroon">Opportunities for leadership</h2>
									<p>In addition to the finding leadership opportunities in audit fieldwork, Ashley has sought to widen her vision of leadership to include PwC at a national level and to her community. In the fall of 2011, Ashley accepted an invitation to serve on the Assurance Experience Council as the experienced associate representative for the Carolinas market. “I’ve been honored to represent my peer group to national leadership. All the major players in the firm’s Assurance practice are present at Assurance Experience Council meetings, seeking ideas and feedback on how to evolve the business,” Ashley said. Topics that have been addressed by the council include changes that will have an impact on the firm’s culture and how to keep people engaged, happy, and excited about the work they do and PwC. “All of the Assurance leaders are there and they want to get feedback from us,” she said. “They present their ideas to us for our feedback and often ask us to present our solutions to leadership. Then the roles are reversed and we have an opportunity to bring our ideas and suggestions to the national level. The goal is to generate a two-way dialogue with leadership that is innovative and that will make PwC an even better place than it already is to work and grow your career. As a representative for the Carolinas, it’s a great opportunity to solicit comments from my market, and to then raise those thoughts to the people who can make a difference. That all feels pretty good, knowing that PwC is interested in hearing our perspectives, and that our input is important to the firm.” <br/><br/>

									Outside of PwC, Ashley is an active board member and chair of the finance committee for Charlotte Concerts, a local non-profit organization, where she joins her accounting knowledge with her love of classical music. “We bring music education into the Charlotte community with concerts and outreach programs. We also purchase dozens of musical instruments each year for community school children and sponsor elementary and high school orchestras and bands. Being part of the PwC community through work, both locally and nationally, is very enriching—but taking the skills I’ve gained from working at PwC and sharing them with the community, to directly impact people outside of work is what brings the PwC experience full-circle.” <br/><br/>

									<p>We've all heard about the importance of having a mentor in our careers, someone to help guide us, give us advice, and teach us things we need to know about the business world.  Mentoring is not a new concept and has been around in some form or fashion for a very long time.  But what if we decided to take a different approach to mentoring, turn things upside down and challenge the traditional approach we've always had to the mentoring relationship?  That is the idea behind the concept of the Reverse Mentoring Program PwC's Greater Atlanta Market has been piloting for the last year.

									<p>We've all heard about the importance of having a mentor in our careers, someone to help guide us, give us advice, and teach us things we need to know about the business world.  Mentoring is not a new concept and has been around in some form or fashion for a very long time.  But what if we decided to take a different approach to mentoring, turn things upside down and challenge the traditional approach we've always had to the mentoring relationship?  That is the idea behind the concept of the Reverse Mentoring Program PwC's Greater Atlanta Market has been piloting for the last year.  Reverse Mentoring challenges the traditional hierarchy and turns the traditional mentoring relationship upside down, by assigning new staff members as the mentors for more experienced, seasoned partners and principals.</p>
